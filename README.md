go-resolve-hosts
================

This is a simple utility written in Go that reads files named "*.hosts" in the specified directory.  Each line, unless blank or starting with '#', is treated as a host to be resolved.  Once all hosts have been resolved, the IPs are written out to that same directory to files without the ".hosts" suffix.

Usage:
------

```
./go-resolve-hosts -dir /directory/containing/hosts/files
```
